# Building a Queue in Python
# Before we start let us reiterate the key components of a queue.

# A queue is a data structure that consists of two main operations: enqueue and dequeue.

# Enqueue is when you add a element to the tail of the queue and a pop is when you remove an element from the head of the queue.

# Python 3.x conviently allows us to demonstate this functionality with a list. When you have a list such as [2,4,5,6] you can decide which end of the list is the front and the back of the queue respectively.

# Once you decide that, you can use the append, pop or insert function to simulate a queue.

# We will choose the first element to be the front of our queue and therefore be using the append and pop functions to simulate it. Give it a try by implementing the function below!
