# Functionality
# Our goal will be to implement a Stack class that has the following behaviors:

# push - adds an item to the top of the stack
# pop - removes an item from the top of the stack (and returns the value of that item)
# size - returns the size of the stack
# top - returns the value of the item at the top of stack (without removing that item)
# is_empty - returns True if the stack is empty and False otherwise
